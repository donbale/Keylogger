Python is a really easy programming language for beginners. What better way to showcase it's range of abilities than making a simple keylogger.

This script requires the pyWin32 and pyHook modules which can be downloaded from: goo.gl/DdKLg 

Make sure to download the module corresponding to your version of Python (cp36 for Python 3.6.x) and install via pip before running.

If you get errors regarding pythoncom36.dll and pywintypes36.dll you may need to follow the instructions here: goo.gl/vjxNKV

To have this script launch in the background when a user accesses a program associate the launch.bat file with the relevant shortcut.

To make the launch more descreet change the shortcut to run in minimalized mode via propertties, this prevents the cmdline opening.

Finally as it stands there is no quit function in the code so to stop you have to kill the pyw and pythonw processes.

If you test this out on someone make sure they know you are doing it, because we don't condone malicious use of this program.

Seriously - "Hack to learn, don't learn to Hack"
